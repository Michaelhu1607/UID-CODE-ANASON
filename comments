    Code comments:
        I've added colours for the section backgrounds, its for easier identification of
        white colored text/icons and the differentiation of sections. I will be starting
        on the report of the assignment tomorrow and I am currently creating a rough 
        layout for each page. 

        For coding flexible pages, can re-watch lecture 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 10.1, 10.3 and 10.4
        for additional reference.

    Design Comments:
        I've made some changes in the design for the food page, i'll email the edits with
        you when I am done with the design changes from the comments atie gave for assignment 2.

2nd June 5.24am:
    - I've finished the layout for index.html (except for the first part and navigation, I havent figured those out yet)
    - Also done with the footer layout, so the footer code is all done now.
    - I've added a spacing.css because i think the layout.css is getting too long, so im just using another css to do the margin/paddings
    so it doesnt get too confusing when we are debugging :D

2nd June 14:31am:
      I've made some adjustment on most html skeleton for navigation bar, I've nearly finished the navigation bar. Keep adjusting it and start the about page layout.
