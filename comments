    Code comments:
        I've added colours for the section backgrounds, its for easier identification of
        white colored text/icons and the differentiation of sections. I will be starting
        on the report of the assignment tomorrow and I am currently creating a rough 
        layout for each page. 

        For coding flexible pages, can re-watch lecture 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 10.1, 10.3 and 10.4
        for additional reference.

    Design Comments:
        I've made some changes in the design for the food page, i'll email the edits with
        you when I am done with the design changes from the comments atie gave for assignment 2.
